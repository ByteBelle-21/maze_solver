# ðŸ§­ Maze Solver using Reinforcement Learning 

> ðŸš§ This project is still in development. Features are being tested and added incrementally.

This project aims to build a maze-solving agent using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) in a custom OpenAI Gym environment. The maze is provided as an image, which is processed into a binary format. The agent learns to navigate from an automatically detected start point to an end point.

## âœ… Current Progress

- [x] Image upload and visualization via Colab
- [x] Conversion of maze image to binary matrix
- [x] Detection of start and end points from border openings
- [x] Custom Gym environment (`mazeEnv`) created
- [x] Random exploration episodes (basic testing)
- [x] DQN setup using Stable-Baselines3

## ðŸ”„ Still In Progress

- [ ] Agent path visualization on the maze
- [ ] Saving and reloading trained models
- [ ] Handling more complex maze shapes and edge cases
- [ ] Training optimization and performance analysis
